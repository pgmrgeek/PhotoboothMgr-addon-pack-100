================== 

BETA release 9.02 (A work in progress)

Photobooth Manager is a complete photobooth software solution written for the IBM PC, using Adobe Photoshop Javascript, actions and Microsoft Visual Studio Visual Basic .NET 4.5, for XP, Win7 and Win 8.  This program requires Photoshop CS2 but runs for the most part on all subsequent versions.  

This Add-on Pack adds 6 additional custom background/foregrounds to the default set provided.

To Install this Add-on Pack -

Copy the included subfolders into the "c:\OnSite" folder.  When prompted by Windows, select "Merge the folders" , 
no files will be overwritten.  Now, fireup photoshop.  You must install the action set.  In photoshop, open the actions palette via the Windows->actions pulldown menu.  Make sure there is not an "Onsite-Printing-100" action set already loaded.  If so, drag it to the trash can at the bottom of the palette.  Now, Drag/drop the new  "c:\OnSite\actions\Onsite-Printing-100.atn" into photoshop.  This will load the action set into the action palette.  

fireup "c:\OnSite\software\launch.bat" to start Pic2Print.exe.  Go to the configuration panel and pull down the
Bk/Fg Selection menu list.  You should now see new bk/fg layouts numbered 100-105.

All systems Go!  Please use GitHub Issues list on this repository to address problems and bugs.
